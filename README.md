# PFAboutWindow ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-lightgreen.svg) ![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-OSX-blue.svg)
A sleek replacement for the otherwise bleak "About" dialog. Its nice, looks like Xcode 6's one, and offers the following abilities : 
* Open the app's website by clicking its (big) icon (in the dialog) (see *Usage* below)
* Extend the dialog to show the "License Agreement", or
* The "Acknowledgments" (see *Content* below),
* Translate the button's text (see *Localization* below),
* Change the background and text colors
* [Also has a Swift version](https://github.com/T-Rex-Editor/TRexAboutWIndowController), by [@dehlen](https://github.com/dehlen)

## Setup

### Manually

Clone this repo and add files from `PFAboutWindow` to your project.

### Using [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/)

Add `pod 'PFAboutWindow', :git => 'https://github.com/perfaram/PFAboutWindow.git'` to your `Podfile` and run `pod install`.
Add `use_frameworks!` to the end of the `Podfile`.

## Usage

For a live, detailed example, see in `PFAboutWindowExample` directory.

1. Import `PFAboutWindowController`:

   ```objc
   #import <PFAboutWindow/PFAboutWindowController.h>
   ```
2. Create a strong reference to retain the controller, usually in a `@property` of your AppDelegate: 

   ```objc
   @property PFAboutWindowController *aboutWindowController;
   ```
3. Instantiate `PFAboutWindow` (in `applicationDidFinishLaunching:`, most likely) :

   ```objc
   self.aboutWindowController = [[PFAboutWindowController alloc] init];
   ```
  
   You may want to personalize what's going to show up on the window. As every property is accessible, you can tweak everything you want (see `PFAboutWindow/PFAboutWindowController.h` to see them all, and what they fall back to): 
   ```objc
   [self.aboutWindowController setAppURL:[[NSURL alloc] initWithString:@"http://app.faramaz.com"]];
   [self.aboutWindowController setAppCopyright:[[NSAttributedString alloc] initWithString:@"Nice Small String"
                                                                               attributes:@{
                                                           NSForegroundColorAttributeName:[NSColor tertiaryLabelColor],
                                                                      NSFontAttributeName:[NSFont fontWithName:@"HelveticaNeue" size:11]}]]; //NSAttributedStrings are real shit to work with
   [self.aboutWindowController setAppName:@"PFAbout"]; //'cause it's shorter
   ```

4. Create an IBAction to display the window, and bind it to its caller (usually, the "About [your app]" menu item):
   ```objc
   - (IBAction)showAboutWindow:(id)sender {
       [self.aboutWindowController showWindow:nil];
   }
   ```

5. You may also want the localize the buttons' text : 
   
   Add the following lines to your Localizable.string (below, for example, French)
   ```
    /* Version %@ (Build %@), displayed in the about window */
    "Version %@ (Build %@)" = "Version %@ (%@)";

    /* Caption of the 'Acknowledgments' button in the about window */
    "Credits" = "Remerciements";
    
    /* Caption of the 'License Agreement' button in the about window */
    "EULA" = "CL Utilisateur Final";
   ```
